    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I’m Anusha :)</h2>
    <div> 
        <p>
          I’m a second-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University,
          with a growing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
          Some of my favorite classes so far have been Math of Data Models,
          Statistics, and Machine Learning, where I’ve enjoyed exploring how data
          and algorithms can be used to solve real-world problems. Beyond the
          classroom, I’m passionate about creating—whether that’s building coding
          projects or making art. I love the process of bringing ideas to life and
          learning something new along the way. On campus, I’m actively involved in
          Northeastern’s community. I currently serve as the treasurer for both the
          university’s literary magazine and Women in Technology, where I help
          manage logistics and plan large-scale events. I find a lot of joy in
          seeing these events come together and creating spaces where people can
          connect and collaborate. I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my
          skills to meaningful projects and work with others who are just as curious
          and driven. Thanks for stopping by!
