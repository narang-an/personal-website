I added a background color and set a default font. I also changed the colors of certain font headings. 
I made a nav bar where the font changes color when the user hover's over the link. In the experience 
section I found some code for a basic timeline that looked really cool though W3Schools tutorial. I adapted 
this CSS by changing the layout, colors, and shapes of the boxes a bit.
